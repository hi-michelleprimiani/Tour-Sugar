Step 1: Analytical Thinking

Which modules should you create?

I will create modules for each component of interest that Sam needs. Venues, Bookings & Bands.

What is the responsibility of each module?

Each module will export functions and addEventListeners to manipulate and represent data that is stored in database

What functions should be in which modules?

Venue : HTML in bullet list to iterate thru venue database. on click, display all of the bands that have booked the venue
Bands : HTML in bullet list to iterate thru band database. on click, display all venues band is playing
Bookings : HTML display all booking Sam has done. on click, display band info

What is the responsibility of each function?

What should each function return?

HTML output

Step 2: Algorithmic Thinking

In which order should you invoke your functions?

What data do you need to get from your database when an event listener is triggered?

In what order should the data be navigated with for..of loops?

What is the specific algorithm for each function? Does the function need parameters? Should it return something?
